libbde is a library to access the BitLocker Drive Encryption (BDE) format.
BitLocker Drive Encryption (BDE) is a volume-based encryption method used by
Microsoft Windows, as of Vista, to encrypt data on a storage media volume.

Project information:

* Status: alpha
* Licence: LGPLv3+

Supported BDE formats:

* BitLocker Windows Vista
* BitLocker Windows 7
* BitLocker Windows 8
* BitLocker Windows 10
* BitLocker To Go

Supported encryption methods:

* AES-CBC
* AES-XTS

Supported protection methods:

* clear key
* password
* recovery password
* start-up key
* FKEV and/or TWEAK key data

Unsupported BDE formats:

* Bitlocker Used Disk Space Only encryption

Unsupported protection methods:

* Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
* SID-based protector

Additional features:

* support for partial encrypted volumes
* zeros out the BDE metadata, matches behavior seen on Windows

Work in progress:

* Dokan library support
* Thread-safety in volume API functions
